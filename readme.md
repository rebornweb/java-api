## Documentation

Use GitHub Actions with Docker to set up an Azure Web App Service and configure a workflow in both Azure and GitHub. 

  

Utilize VSCode with the Java IntelliSense extension. 

 Java: 

  

- Spring Boot 

- Maven 

- Official documentation and Spring guides. 

  

I could have manually initialized the project, but I wanted to dive straight into the REST service boilerplate, similar to how I would in .NET Core with Visual Studio API. 

  

Use Jackson as a dependency for handling JSON data. 

  

**Unit Tests:** 

  
- Jest 

- JUnit 

  

**What I Would Do If I Had More Time:** 

  
Create a `CheeseContext` to wrap around the necessary components.  
- I would also fix the module issues I had when running Jest tests.
